jongyon7192p:I've wondering how you got THAT FAR. hi I just got here
fate:this game doesnt seem very eventful
sonokosuzuki:ya
jongyon7192p:CN2 f100?
yoburg:3 screens long screen
senjai3:AkiramenaiYo
sonokosuzuki:fourth screen seems really bad gl with that
sonokosuzuki:one of the screens in the gmk is unused too
sonokosuzuki:lame
dj_cornflakes:alright kids its time for another bet!
shadowlink57:lame
dj_cornflakes:How many kicks does it take to get to the center of a baby skull?
fate:creator gave it an 1 FeelsBadMan
dj_cornflakes:make your bets!
dj_cornflakes:the bets are in!
sonokosuzuki:i kind of want to see someone learn these screens blind
capnsquid:yoyoMMM
dj_cornflakes:3 kicks! it takes 3 kicks! who guessed 3?
reiben99:@DJ_Cornflakes, how old is the kid? :)
dj_cornflakes:he was 6 months
dj_cornflakes:the people who guessed 3 get to split the jackpot!
luveluen:since he is a kid he has to be 14 or younger
luveluen:I think it could vary from game to game
luveluen:in some games he even appears to be more 16ish
dj_cornflakes:lol luve
dj_cornflakes:we are talking about kicking in baby skulls you silly billy
luveluen:no you
broshock_:I think the age question was definitely about the kid, and that was a great answer by luve
dk_meister:Normally playing quickly is more efficient because you get more runs in, but on a screen this long it's better to go slow.
dk_meister:I think you were getting to the bottom right more consistently before you started playing quick
dj_cornflakes:why he ask the guy with the baby skulls then broshock_ ?
dj_cornflakes:he was simply solidifying his baby skull beating bet
broshock_:Because you seemed like an expert
raiu2015:Well, my liver currently hates me.
moobot:Go here to see the current roulette streak progress! https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JuG_w503rEqvtiM2ALTk3499z9jYANlIxNDIXG4ksQA/edit?usp=sharing
dj_cornflakes:well that is true as well
dj_cornflakes:luve was completely right
bleekers:All these grunts, groans and COME ONs , is really channeling my inner KappaPride
fate:optimally, speed and how far are you in are inversely proportional
dionissium:lmao
jongyon7192p:I had ideas for bot chains.
dj_cornflakes:Well fate we start with a clean baby skull, but speed is a big factor
jongyon7192p:About 5 bots !cmding each other
tagherion:Shadesbolt?
dj_cornflakes:it takes about 25 kms per hour to pierce the skull
dj_cornflakes:each kick was around 10-15
luveluen:a true scientist
sonokosuzuki:ofc not thats why he says its a bad game
yoburg:or even 2 (cough-cough-scribble)
sonokosuzuki:maybe he set out to make a bad game :o
luveluen:a true scientist maybe
fate:hes created his bad game incorrectly :<

luveluen:since english long since stopped marking vowels as they are actually prnounced... I don't think english orthography has any meaning today ^^
arras01:meltdown isn't insanely hard if you don't do the avoidances
yoburg:Wow. It's not even been 2 days since C2 release and noone is streaming it already PogChamp
dj_cornflakes:why play shit game for shit people?
luveluen:people have either beaten it or gone nuts ;P

klazen108:"here we see a thwomp in its natural habitat"
tigerdragon13:lol would be cool if thwomps didn't trigger with thwomp skin
arclooper:I think it might be due to the coins not being actually round
arclooper:and being spinning in the opposite direction as the group spin

mrwonderfulman:nah klazen
jewjosh:tj how do i jump jump
klazen108:no offense to you, just serious curiosity on my part
mrwonderfulman:it is the players who are wrong
klazen108:yeah you act just like everyone else, not jumping
mrwonderfulman:or like half the people on boss 4 who assume they can't shoot the vines in the kirby phase
klazen108:its not your fault
arclooper:I think it's the mood :o
thetaeolution:Its gravitys fault
mrwonderfulman:and dont even try, and yell at their bad rng of the vines walling them
arclooper:for this boss
tigerdragon13:usually you die enough, jump, and then can't complain b/c the creators aren't there
tigerdragon13:then you forget i think
arclooper:the vines is just people not even experimenting
mrwonderfulman:instead of trying new things they say "wow this attack is really stupid sometimes" arc :(
arclooper::(
arclooper:a lot of people I see playing never try to shoot things tbh :o

ml_kuja:and some visual/audio feedback
klazen108:(we're not yelling at you we're just stressed at hearing that all weekend MingLee )
arclooper:tho with TJ I'll agree that maybe the aesthetics give the impression that you might not be able to double jump
thetaeolution:The only boss i bitched at a stupid amount was the IDWBA boss in boss rush
arclooper:the whole hand pushing in the direction and mood of the fight might make it look like you're being helplessly launched :o

mrwonderfulman:well, the difference between this and idwba2 is that this is much more straightforward most of the way
thetaeolution:An ideal speedrun is lovely planet MingLee
mrwonderfulman:it's basically regular platforming, and practicing some bosses
klazen108:I like watching long speedruns, but doing short speedruns
mrwonderfulman:the bosses are easy to get consistent at in this
klazen108:splatoon is the perfect balance pieSnug
